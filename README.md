# Portfolio web app

### Overview
This project is a portfolio web application built with streamlit
and pandas in which each colum on the page is dynamic as it takes the
data from a CSV file and iterates through it. In addition, there is a 
function to send an email with a message.

This app was built as part of the python mega course (PMC) taught by Ardit Sulce
